Can you reliably get good solutions? How many generations does it take? How does this depend on how hard the puzzle is? Does adding additional genetic operators improve performance?

We can get reliably good solutions depending on how hard the puzzle is. If the puzzle only has just a few missing parts, it will take a very little number of generations to solve, and as the number of missing parts grows, so does the number of generations, and possibly populations. But the solutions we got for the test cases above show that the 
algorithm is indeed reliable, and works for even some hard cases, but if tested with a very hard puzzle, we would most likely need a very large number of generations and 
population size to solve, which might exceed the run time limit. We believe that adding additional genetic operators could improve the performance, and may even help solve
the harder puzzles.

Test case 1:
423751968759683024160249357945362871872915036316478295537194602691827543284536019

run: 20 populations and 5 generations 
Best fit: 9

run: 20 populations and 10 generations
Best fit: 6

run: 20 populations and 20 generations
Best fit: 3

run: 20 populations and 40 generations
Best fit: 0

So after running all 4 runs we can say that the more generations you input, the better best fit puzzle you will get at the end.

Test case 2: Added more zeroes to the solved puzzle.
423051068750683024160249357945062071072015036316478295537194602691827543284536019

run: 40 populations and 5 generations
Best fit: 13

run: 40 populations and 10 generations
Best fit: 8

run: 40 populations and 20 generations
Best fit: 3

run: 40 populations and 40 generations
Best fit: 0

So it seems that adding just a few more zeroes does not change the outcome by much.

Test case 3: Added more zeroes to the solved puzzle.
423051068750683024160240300945062071072005036306478295537194602691827543284536019

run: 100 populations and 5 generations
Best fit: 22

run: 100 populations and 10 generations
Best fit: 18

run: 100 populations and 20 generations

Best fit: 11

run: 100 populations and 40 generations

Best fit: 3

run: 100 populations and 50 generations

Best fit: 0

It seems that as we are adding more zeroes, the more generations we have to go through in order to find the best fit puzzle.

Test case 4: Added even more zeroes
